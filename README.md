## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the application of various regression and classification techniques using Python. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these models work and how to implement them using popular machine learning libraries.

## Datasets
The repository uses the following datasets:
- **Ames Housing Dataset**: Used for regression techniques to predict house prices.
- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: Used for binary classification using logistic regression.
- **Iris Dataset**: Used for multiclass classification using multinomial logistic regression.

## Regression Techniques

### Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is used to predict the target variable using a single feature. In this repository, we use the `Gr Liv Area` feature from the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices.

### Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression uses multiple features to predict the target variable. We use `Gr Liv Area`, `Overall Qual`, and `Year Built` features from the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices.

### Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression is used to model the relationship between the target variable and the features as an nth degree polynomial. We use the `Gr Liv Area` feature from the Ames Housing dataset and transform it into polynomial features to predict house prices.

## Classification Techniques

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems. We use the Breast Cancer dataset to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

### Multinomial Logistic Regression
Multinomial Logistic Regression is used for multiclass classification problems. We use the Iris dataset to classify the species of iris flowers.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) for regression models, and accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for classification models.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-regression-classification.git
    cd machine-learning-regression-classification
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore the code and results.
